Introduction
We ask you for the proper conduct of this evaluation to
respect the following rules:
- Stay courteous, polite, respectful and constructive in all
situations during this exchange. The bond of trust between the
community 42 and you depends on it.
- Highlight to the person (or group) noted any
dysfunctions of the work rendered, and take the time
to discuss and debate it.
- Accept that there may sometimes be differences
of interpretation on the subject's requests or the scope of the
functionalities. Stay open-minded towards the other's vision
(is he or she right or wrong?), And rate the most
honestly possible. The pedagogy of 42 only makes sense if
the peer assessment is done seriously.
Guidelines
- You should only evaluate what is on the GiT repository
for the student or the group.
- Take care to verify that the GiT repository is the one
corresponding to the student or group, and to the project.
- Check meticulously that no malicious alias has been used
to mislead you and have you evaluate something other than

the content of the official deposit.
- Any script intended to facilitate the evaluation provided by one of the two
parties must be rigorously checked by the other party to
avoid unpleasant surprises.
- If the corrector student has not yet made this
project, it is compulsory for this student to read the
entire subject before starting this defense.
- Use the flags available on this scale to report an
empty, non-functional report, a case of cheating,
etc. In this case, the evaluation is completed and the final grade is
0 (or -42 in the special case of cheating). However, except in case
of cheating, you are encouraged to continue to exchange around the
work done (or not done right) to identify the
problems that led to this situation and avoid them for the
next report.

Preliminary instructions
First check the following:
- There is a rendering (in the git repository)
- No cheating, the student must be able to explain his code.
- Author file, external libraries used to justify ...
If an element of this list is not respected, the notation stops there. Use the appropriate flag. You are
encouraged to continue debating the project, but the scale is not applied.

Try the program without parameters, with too many parameters, with invalid parameters, with
invalid sequences ... In short, try to put the program in fault. Does the program have the
expected behaviors (display of usage, quits with a message, etc.)?

Simple position
Try the program with simple mixes, up to 4-5 movements only. Does the result
is correct ? Does it appear within a reasonable time (2-3 seconds)? If the answer to any of these questions is
no, the defense stops there.

Slightly more complex position
Try the program with more complex mixes, between 5 and 20 movements. Is the result
correct? Does it appear within a reasonable time (2-3 seconds)? If the answer to any of these questions is
no, the defense stops there.

Random position
Try the program with random mixes larger than 20 movements. Is the
result is correct? Does it appear within a reasonable time (2-3 seconds)? If the answer to any of these
questions is no, the defense stops there.

Performance
For mixtures of size greater than thirty movements, is the program capable of
solve on average in less than 150 movements and always within 2-3 seconds, including display?
If the answer is no, then put 0 to this question.
Add 1 point for every 20 movements won.
Rate it from 0 (failed) through 5 (excellent)

This position, called superflip, is one of the positions that always requires at least 20 movements
to be resolved ("Distance-20"). Does the program solve this Cube in a number of movements
comparable to the results of the previous questions? Try other blends like this

Bonus part
Program bonus
The bonus scale is at the discretion of the corrector. A truly hardcore bonus deserves more than two
really easy bonus. For example, among the super class bonuses, which should be worth a lot of points if they
are correctly performed:
- Presence of a real graphic interface in 3D which dislocates (for example which shows the resolution to the blow
per stroke)
- A really neat algorithm that goes down to the borders of what is possible (an average of less than 30
movements, always in a few seconds, it's really very very VERY good and clearly deserves a big
bonus)
- A choice between several resolution algorithms, or even the automatic selection of the best of these
algorithms as appropriate
- A program that accepts other size n puzzles or odd shapes (2x2x2, 4x4x4, Megaminx,
Square-1 ...)
- ...
In the really less hardcore but nevertheless useful bonuses, we can for example find:
- A generator of mixtures,
- A subdivision of the answer into "humanly understandable" steps
- ...
Rate it from 0 (failed) through 5 (excellent)
Fixed bonus
Find a Rubik's Cube and demonstrate your agility. The more impressive, the better. Hint: Under 30-40
seconds, it's VERY impressive. But it's not just speed in life, be inventive! And
talk about it among yourselves ... :-)
